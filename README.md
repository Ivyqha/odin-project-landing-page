# odin-project-landing-page
Creating an entire web page based off a design template provided by the Odin Project course 

For this project, i decided to create a landing page for a photography business, that showcases photos taken over the years from former holidays or events as a portfolio for future clients (All photos used on this web page are all credits of my own - photos i have taken in the past)
